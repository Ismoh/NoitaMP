I love to play [Noita](https://noitagame.com/)! You should give it a try!
Usually I like to play with my friends. Truly Noita is made for being a single-player game,
but I can't get rid of the idea to try implementing a multiplayer mod, just to share all the feelings playing Noita with
friends.

Let's see, if I can do so?! I am new to Lua and modding, but someone said to me: "You seem to be asking the right questions".

### Used libraries, frameworks and other stuff

Also, special thanks to the people, who share their libraries, frameworks and other stuff. See below!

- custom lua51.dll provided by Noita
- [luaJIT-2.0.4](https://github.com/LuaJIT/LuaJIT/releases/tag/v2.0.4) used by Noita
- [eNet](http://enet.bespin.org/) for network communication
- [lua-enet](https://github.com/leafo/lua-enet) for being able to use eNet in Lua
- [sock.lua](https://github.com/camchenry/sock.lua) for 'easy' to use lua-enet and eNet in Lua
- ~~[bitser.lua](https://github.com/gvx/bitser) for old serializing and deserializing data~~
- [pprint.lua](https://github.com/jagt/pprint.lua) for debugging with pretty prints
- ~~[json.lua](https://github.com/rxi/json.lua) for serializing and deserializing data in json format~~
- [nxml.lua](https://github.com/zatherz/luanxml) for editing xml files used by Noita
- ~~[EZGUI.lua](https://github.com/TheHorscht/EZGUI) for the GUI, but unfortunately it isn't maintained anymore~~
- [lua-watcher.lua](https://github.com/EvandroLG/lua-watcher) for getting the correct save path for Noita
- [lfs-ffi.lua](https://github.com/sonoro1234/luafilesystem) for lua file system
- [deepcopy.lua](https://gist.github.com/Deco/3985043) for being able to copy tables
- [libzstd.dll](https://github.com/facebook/zstd) for being able to compress and decompress data
- [zstd.lua](https://github.com/sjnam/luajit-zstd) for easy to use libzstd.dll in Lua
- [lua-MessagePack](https://framagit.org/fperrad/lua-MessagePack/-/tree/0.5.2) for serializing and deserializing data
- [plotly.lua](https://github.com/kenloen/plotly.lua) for plotting profiled data
- [dkjson.lua](https://github.com/LuaDist/dkjson) needed by plotly.lua

I had to build the network library by my own, because Noita provides its own lua51.dll. I struggled to build it, if you are interested in,
I've added all the necessary build files inside of .building/dll_building.7z and here you can see the [stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70048918/lua-5-1-package-loadlib-and-require-gcc-building-windows-dll) I've created.
